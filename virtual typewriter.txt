 It's a typewriter.  Type on one piece of paper.  You type and when you are finished, the page comes out your printer (paper/printer not included - you must have your own ;-)  Have Fun!


 When ever I try to type anything lengthy on the computer, the edit/notepad makes the entry really quick!  It also makes the 'Select All/Delete' really quick too - except trying to remember what you were typing, or how to make it better is not so easy.  If you keep everything you write, you become a better writer.

 I have wanted to make a short story for some time, but keep 'Select All/Delete' my story because I think it's not good enough.  But then the next try I figure I am just writing the same thing again... 'Select All/Delete' --- and the cycle continues.

 It was easier to use a typewriter to force myself to keep moving forward! - but my typewriter died and I can't fix it!

 So, I made this: Virtual Typewriter
